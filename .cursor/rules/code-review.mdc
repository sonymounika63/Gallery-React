# Code Review Standards

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Size Requirements
- Maximum PR size: 400 lines
- Split large changes into smaller, focused PRs
- Keep changes atomic and focused
- Consider impact on review process

## Testing Requirements
Ensure comprehensive test coverage:

### Test Coverage
- All new code must include tests
- Follow testing standards in [testing.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/testing.mdc)
- Include unit tests for new functionality
- Avoid making a ton of changes to existing tests while refactoring

### Code Documentation
- Document complex logic with comments
- Explain non-obvious implementation details
- Document features added and important caveats in README

### Review Process
- Review for code quality
- Check for test coverage
- Verify documentation
- Ensure adherence to project standards

## Best Practices
- Keep PRs focused and manageable
- Include clear PR descriptions
- Reference related issues/tickets
- Respond to review comments promptly
